{"id":"nvim-1ie","title":"Explore: beadboard claude code integrations","description":"## Acceptance Criteria\n- Findings stored in bead design field (not filesystem)\n- Structured as Current State, Recommendation, and phased Next Steps\n- Each phase is independently actionable","design":"## Current State\n\n### Plugin config (init.lua:139-156)\nBeadboard pinned at `8bf8891` on `main`. Config declares 10 commands\nand 9 keymaps (`\u003cleader\u003et*`). No claude options passed.\n\n### New commits (not yet pulled)\nTwo commits ahead:\n- `7bed72d` feat: Claude Code integration — new `claude.lua` (274 lines),\n  modified detail.lua, list.lua, init.lua, plugin/beadboard.lua (+374 lines)\n- `42f7591` docs: README additions for Claude Code integration\n\n### New features\n- **`claude.lua` module**: `run()`, `pick_and_run()`, `focus()`,\n  `discover_skills()`, `refresh_skills()`, session tracking, auto-refresh\n- **Keybindings**: `gC` (list/detail) = skill picker, `gT` (detail) = focus session\n- **Commands**: `:BdClaude \u003cskill\u003e \u003cid\u003e`, `:BdQuickExplore \u003ctopic\u003e`,\n  `:BdQuickFix [feedback]`\n- **Config options**: `claude_cmd`, `claude_default_mode`, `claude_model`\n- **Auto-refresh**: terminal exit refreshes views; BufEnter checks staleness (\u003e5s)\n\n### Critical issue: skill discovery broken\n`discover_skills()` gates on `user-invocable: true` in SKILL.md frontmatter.\nNone of the user's 13 skills have this field — it was explicitly removed from\nconvention. `gC` will show empty picker.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate plugin and fix the `user-invocable` gate in `discover_skills()` — remove\nthe check so all skills with a `name` field are included. The relevance-ranking\nin `build_skill_list` already handles prioritization. Also update nvim config to\nadd new commands to lazy-loading triggers and optionally add quick-access keymaps.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n**Phase 1: Update plugin lock**\n1. Run `:Lazy update beadboard` or update lazy-lock.json to `42f7591`\n2. Restart neovim, verify plugin loads\n\n**Phase 2: Fix skill discovery**\n3. In `claude.lua`, change `if name and invocable then` to `if name then`\n4. Test `gC` from list view — should show all 13 skills\n\n**Phase 3: Update nvim config lazy-loading triggers**\n5. Add `BdClaude`, `BdQuickExplore`, `BdQuickFix` to `cmd` table\n6. Optionally add keymaps: `\u003cleader\u003etx` → BdQuickExplore, `\u003cleader\u003etf` → BdQuickFix\n\n**Phase 4: Configure claude options**\n7. Pass config in opts if needed (claude_cmd, claude_model)\n\n**Phase 5: Validate end-to-end**\n8. Open Beadboard, navigate to bead, press gC — skill picker with ranked skills\n9. Select skill — terminal split with `claude /skill bead-id`\n10. Exit session — views auto-refresh\n11. gC on active session — focuses existing terminal\n\n**Phase 6: Submit upstream fix**\n12. PR the `user-invocable` gate removal to jfmyers9/beadboard\n\n**Phase 7: Test quick-action commands**\n13. BdQuickExplore, BdQuickFix, BdClaude direct dispatch","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"jim.myers@jfmyers.dev","created_at":"2026-02-12T21:51:14.06405-08:00","created_by":"Jim Myers","updated_at":"2026-02-12T21:56:01.572217-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-12T21:56:01.572217-08:00","close_reason":"Converted to epic nvim-76s"}
