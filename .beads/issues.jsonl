{"id":"nvim-1ie","title":"Explore: beadboard claude code integrations","description":"## Acceptance Criteria\n- Findings stored in bead design field (not filesystem)\n- Structured as Current State, Recommendation, and phased Next Steps\n- Each phase is independently actionable","design":"## Current State\n\n### Plugin config (init.lua:139-156)\nBeadboard pinned at `8bf8891` on `main`. Config declares 10 commands\nand 9 keymaps (`\u003cleader\u003et*`). No claude options passed.\n\n### New commits (not yet pulled)\nTwo commits ahead:\n- `7bed72d` feat: Claude Code integration — new `claude.lua` (274 lines),\n  modified detail.lua, list.lua, init.lua, plugin/beadboard.lua (+374 lines)\n- `42f7591` docs: README additions for Claude Code integration\n\n### New features\n- **`claude.lua` module**: `run()`, `pick_and_run()`, `focus()`,\n  `discover_skills()`, `refresh_skills()`, session tracking, auto-refresh\n- **Keybindings**: `gC` (list/detail) = skill picker, `gT` (detail) = focus session\n- **Commands**: `:BdClaude \u003cskill\u003e \u003cid\u003e`, `:BdQuickExplore \u003ctopic\u003e`,\n  `:BdQuickFix [feedback]`\n- **Config options**: `claude_cmd`, `claude_default_mode`, `claude_model`\n- **Auto-refresh**: terminal exit refreshes views; BufEnter checks staleness (\u003e5s)\n\n### Critical issue: skill discovery broken\n`discover_skills()` gates on `user-invocable: true` in SKILL.md frontmatter.\nNone of the user's 13 skills have this field — it was explicitly removed from\nconvention. `gC` will show empty picker.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate plugin and fix the `user-invocable` gate in `discover_skills()` — remove\nthe check so all skills with a `name` field are included. The relevance-ranking\nin `build_skill_list` already handles prioritization. Also update nvim config to\nadd new commands to lazy-loading triggers and optionally add quick-access keymaps.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n**Phase 1: Update plugin lock**\n1. Run `:Lazy update beadboard` or update lazy-lock.json to `42f7591`\n2. Restart neovim, verify plugin loads\n\n**Phase 2: Fix skill discovery**\n3. In `claude.lua`, change `if name and invocable then` to `if name then`\n4. Test `gC` from list view — should show all 13 skills\n\n**Phase 3: Update nvim config lazy-loading triggers**\n5. Add `BdClaude`, `BdQuickExplore`, `BdQuickFix` to `cmd` table\n6. Optionally add keymaps: `\u003cleader\u003etx` → BdQuickExplore, `\u003cleader\u003etf` → BdQuickFix\n\n**Phase 4: Configure claude options**\n7. Pass config in opts if needed (claude_cmd, claude_model)\n\n**Phase 5: Validate end-to-end**\n8. Open Beadboard, navigate to bead, press gC — skill picker with ranked skills\n9. Select skill — terminal split with `claude /skill bead-id`\n10. Exit session — views auto-refresh\n11. gC on active session — focuses existing terminal\n\n**Phase 6: Submit upstream fix**\n12. PR the `user-invocable` gate removal to jfmyers9/beadboard\n\n**Phase 7: Test quick-action commands**\n13.

Auto-detects\n   snacks \u003e telescope \u003e vim.ui.select for issue selection.\n2. **Keymap desc fields** (`f693164`) — all buffer keymaps now have\n   `desc` for which-key. No config changes needed.\n3. **Snacks help float** (`d113e08`) — `?` key uses `Snacks.win`\n   when available, falls back to plain float. Toggle on/off.\n4. **Fix detail back navigation** (`bc8a762`) — `q`/`\u003cBS\u003e` returns\n   to list instead of closing. No config changes.\n\nNo new commands or keymaps to register — existing 13 commands and\n11 keymaps cover everything. Only new config: `picker` option.\n\n### Recommendation\n\nAdd snacks.nvim as a dependency of beadboard to unlock the preferred\npicker and help float. The `picker = 'auto'` default works if snacks\nis installed. No changes to existing command/keymap registration.\n\n## Topic 2: snacks.nvim Integration\n\n### Current State\n\nExisting plugins with snacks overlap:\n- **fzf-lua** → overlaps snacks.picker (keep fzf-lua)\n- **vim-vinegar** → overlaps snacks.explorer (keep vinegar)\n- **vim-rhubarb** → overlaps snacks.gitbrowse (evaluate later)\n\nMissing capabilities snacks fills:\n- No notifier, indent guides, bigfile handling, statuscolumn,\n  smooth scrolling, scratch buffers, floating terminal\n\n### Recommendation\n\nEnable non-overlapping modules. Skip picker, explorer, dashboard\nfor now. Suggested spec:\n\n```lua\n{\n  \"folke/snacks.nvim\",\n  priority = 1000,\n  lazy = false,\n  opts = {\n    bigfile = { enabled = true },\n    indent = { enabled = true },\n    input = { enabled = true },\n    notifier = { enabled = true, timeout = 3000 },\n    quickfile = { enabled = true },\n    scope = { enabled = true },\n    scroll = { enabled = true },\n    statuscolumn = { enabled = true },\n    words = { enabled = true },\n  },\n  keys = {\n    { \"\u003cleader\u003ebd\", function() Snacks.bufdelete() end,\n      desc = \"Delete Buffer\" },\n    { \"\u003cleader\u003egB\", function() Snacks.gitbrowse() end,\n      desc = \"Git Browse\", mode = { \"n\", \"v\" } },\n    { \"\u003cleader\u003egg\", function() Snacks.lazygit() end,\n      desc = \"Lazygit\" },\n    { \"\u003cc-/\u003e\", function() Snacks.terminal() end,\n      desc = \"Toggle Terminal\" },\n    { \"\u003cleader\u003e.\", function() Snacks.scratch() end,\n      desc = \"Toggle Scratch Buffer\" },\n    { \"\u003cleader\u003eS\", function() Snacks.scratch.select() end,\n      desc = \"Select Scratch Buffer\" },\n    { \"\u003cleader\u003ecR\", function() Snacks.rename.rename_file() end,\n      desc = \"Rename File\" },\n    { \"\u003cleader\u003eun\", function() Snacks.notifier.hide() end,\n      desc = \"Dismiss All Notifications\" },\n    { \"]]\", function() Snacks.words.jump(vim.v.count1) end,\n      desc = \"Next Reference\", mode = { \"n\", \"t\" } },\n    { \"[[\", function() Snacks.words.jump(-vim.v.count1) end,\n      desc = \"Prev Reference\", mode = { \"n\", \"t\" } },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## Cross-Topic Connections\n\n- Beadboard commits #1 and #3 both depend on snacks.nvim — adding\n  snacks unlocks the preferred picker backend AND floating help\n- Adding snacks.nvim as beadboard dependency ensures load order\n- `]]`/`[[` override default section jumping — LSP refs more useful\n\n## Next Steps\n\n**Phase 1: Add snacks.nvim core modules**\n1. Add snacks.nvim spec to init.lua with bigfile, quickfile, input,\n   notifier, scroll enabled (zero-config, no keymaps needed)\n2. Run `:checkhealth snacks` to verify\n\n**Phase 2: Visual enhancements**\n3. Enable indent, scope, statuscolumn, words\n4. Verify rendering with tokyonight-storm colorscheme\n\n**Phase 3: Interactive features**\n5. Add keymapped modules: bufdelete, gitbrowse, lazygit, terminal,\n   scratch, rename\n6. Ensure lazygit installed (`brew install lazygit`)\n7. Test each keymap\n\n**Phase 4: Wire up beadboard**\n8. Add snacks.nvim to beadboard's `dependencies` in lazy spec\n9. Optionally set `picker = 'snacks'` in beadboard opts\n10. Test help float (`?`) and issue picker (`gP`) use snacks\n\n**Phase 5: Evaluate replacements (later)**\n11. After weeks of use, evaluate snacks.picker vs fzf-lua\n12. Evaluate snacks.gitbrowse vs vim-rhubarb\n13. Consider snacks.explorer vs vim-vinegar","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"jim.myers@jfmyers.dev","created_at":"2026-02-13T19:25:31.361942-08:00","created_by":"Jim Myers","updated_at":"2026-02-13T19:29:41.000878-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-13T19:29:41.000878-08:00","close_reason":"Converted to epic nvim-dc6"}
